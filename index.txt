Mongoose(ODM for MongoDB)
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
We can also think of it like a “translator” between our JavaScript code and the MongoDB database.
What it does:
- Defines Schemas (the structure of your data).
- Creates Models (blueprints to create, read, update, delete data).
- Handles database queries in a simpler way.
Why we use it:
- Enforces structure in MongoDB (which is normally schema-less).
- Reduces database errors.
- Lets you use JavaScript objects directly with MongoDB.

Dotenv (Environment Variables)
dotenv is a package that loads environment variables from a ".env" file into process.env.
Why we use it:
- Keeps sensitive information (API keys, DB passwords) out of your code.
- Allows easy switching between development and production settings.
- Avoids committing secrets to GitHub.

PS: your ".env" file should always go into your .gitignore file.
- Instead of pushing ".env", create an example file: ".env.example". 
- Inside, put only the variable names, not the values. That way, teammates know what variables to create 
without exposing the actual values.

Summary:
Express = Helps us quickly build web servers and APIs.
Mongoose = Helps you connect and interact with MongoDB easily using JavaScript objects.
Dotenv = Helps you store and access secret values without hardcoding them.
